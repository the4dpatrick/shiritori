#尻取りShiriTori
A Japanese word game

The rules:
>Two or more people take turns to play.
>Only nouns are permitted.
>A player who plays a word ending in the mora N (ん) loses the game, as no Japanese word begins with that character.
>Words may not be repeated.
>Phrases connected by no (の) are permitted, but only in those cases where the phrase is sufficiently fossilized to be considered a "word"
